# TCellDataAnalysis_UMAP
Performed UMAP dimensionality reduction on my flow cytometer data as part of my research project on T-cells. 

## The data set

14-color flow cytometer panel resulting in over 40 different cell populations. PBMCs from 12 donors in 7 different vaccine groups, assessed up to 7 time points.
